## 💾 How Auto-Save Works

1. **Start playing** → Game begins auto-saving
2. **Every 60 seconds** → Automatic save checkpoint
3. **Press ESC** → Saves and returns to menu
4. **Close game** → Final save before exit
5. **Next time** → Click "Continue" to resume!

## 🎯 Test It Out!

```bash
# Test new game
cd code
python main_pokemon.py
# Click "New Game"
# Play for a while
# Notice "Auto-saved" message appears

# Press ESC (returns to menu, auto-saves)
# Click "Continue"
# You're back where you left off!

## 🎨 Customization

Want to change colors, text, or timing? It's easy!

### Change Game Name
Edit `code/menu_pokemon.py` line 234:
```python
'Pokemon-PK'  →  'Your Game Name'
```

### Change Title Colors
Edit `code/menu_pokemon.py` lines 236-237:
```python
(255, 215, 0)  # Yellow → Change this!
(0, 100, 255)  # Blue → Change this!
```

### Change Auto-Save Interval
Edit `code/main_pokemon.py` line 26:
```python
self.auto_save_interval = 60.0  # Change to desired seconds
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Continue" is grayed out?**
→ No save exists yet. Play first, then it will be enabled!

**Font looks different?**
→ Custom font not found, using fallback. Still works perfectly!

**Video not playing?**
→ Optional feature. Beautiful gradient displays instead!

**Any errors?**
→ Check the console output for details
